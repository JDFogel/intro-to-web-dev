# Week 6: For Loops

This week, you'll be displaying information about a speech that you choose.

The speech can be funny, serious, or educational. You can write your own speech,
or you can use a speech from your favorite book, movie, or TV show. You could
also use your favorite poem or song lyrics.

The only requirement about the speech is that it must contain at least 100
words.

After you choose a speech, modify `index.html` and `script.js` to output
information about your speech. In addition to the existing example section that
shows words with more than 5 characters, your page should include these
sections:


- Words with less than 4 characters - CHECK
- Words that start with the same letter as your name (if none, feel free to
  choose a different letter) - CHECK
- The longest word, or the shortest word - CHECK
- Every 3rd word - CHECK
- Words that aren't the 10 most common words - CHECK

There are ways to do some of this without for loops, but the goal of this
project is to practice using for loops. So when you're done, your code should
contain at least 5 for loops, not counting the existing example.

Modifying the CSS is optional, so make sure your JavaScript works first.

Write your code one small piece at a time. Don't try to get all 5 sections
working at once! Write the code for a single section, and then test that single
section in your browser. Check your browser's developer tools console for
errors. When you have a single section working, then move on to a second
section. Repeat that process until you have at least 5 sections.
