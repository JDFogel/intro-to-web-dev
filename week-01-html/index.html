    <h1>Hello Class!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my webpage! My name is Jackson, I'm an English major with minors in History and Government! I'm also a junior, and I've got plenty of hobbies to tell you about.</p>

  	<p>I love to travel! A few years ago I got to go to a bunch of cool places in Italy, including the Colosseum.</p>

  	<p>In the States, every year before the pandemic, my family and I would travel to see our aunts, uncles, cousins, and everyone else in <a href="https://www.siouxfalls.org/">Sioux Falls, South Dakota.</a></p>

	<h2>Theater!</h2>
	<p>My family has been doing live theater since before I was born; my parents even met while performing a play. Below is a quote from Mary Shelley's novel <i>Frankenstein,</i> which was the first monologue I ever performed.</p>
  		<blockquote>I expected this reception. All men hate the wrteched; how then must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.</blockquote>
